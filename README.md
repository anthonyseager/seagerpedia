# seagerpedia

This repo contains the code for the **seagerpedia**, a collection of knowledge, architectural preferences, as well tips and tricks for common pitfalls that I have accumulated and built throughout my software career :).
The seagerpedia is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) project, which is then converted into a static site via [Quartz 4.0](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and hosted at https://moonman.dev/

The code exists on the [v4 branch](https://github.com/anthonyseager/seagerpedia/tree/v4)
